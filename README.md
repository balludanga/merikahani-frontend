# My Fullstack Project - Frontend

This is the frontend part of the My Fullstack Project, built using React.js. This document provides setup instructions and an overview of the components and pages included in the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-fullstack-project/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Project Structure

The frontend project is organized as follows:

- `public/`: Contains static files, including the main HTML file.
  - `index.html`: The entry point for the React application.

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - `components/`: Contains reusable components.
    - `ExampleComponent.jsx`: An example functional component.
  - `pages/`: Contains page components.
    - `ExamplePage.jsx`: An example page component.
  - `App.jsx`: The main application component that sets up routing.
  - `index.js`: The entry point for the React application.

## Example Component

The `ExampleComponent` is a simple functional component that can be used throughout the application. You can import and use it in other components or pages as needed.

## Example Page

The `ExamplePage` component represents a specific page in the application. It can include routing logic and layout to display various content.

## Scripts

The following scripts are available in the `package.json`:

- `npm start`: Starts the development server.
